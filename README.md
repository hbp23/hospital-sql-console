# Hospital SQL Console

## Overview
Hospital SQL Console is a command-line Java application that allows users to execute a curated set of SQL queries against a hospital database (Checkpoint4DB). The application leverages JDBC for database connectivity and loads all queries from an external file (`resources/sql/Checkpoint3.sql`). Users interact via a menu-driven CLI to select and run queries, with results formatted for clarity.

## Features
- **21 curated SQL queries**, grouped into the following categories:
  - **Room Utilization**
  - **Patient Information**
  - **Diagnosis & Treatment**
  - **Employee Information**
- **20 menu options:** Queries 3.1 and 3.2 share the same output and are presented as a single menu choice.
- **Reads queries from** `resources/sql/Checkpoint3.sql`.
- **Command-line interface:** Navigate and execute queries by number or type `exit` to quit.
- **Formatted output:** Results are clearly displayed in the terminal.
- **Robust error handling:** Exceptions are caught and clear feedback is provided.
